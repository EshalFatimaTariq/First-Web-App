# First-Web-App
A simple web application built using Java to manage student records. This project demonstrates how to use Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and MySQL to create, read, update, and delete student data in a web-based interface. The application allows users to manage student information, such as names, roll numbers, courses, and grades.
